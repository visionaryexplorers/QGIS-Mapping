Landslides on Manali-Leh highway disrupted traffic movement while flights returned to Delhi, unable to land at Kullu airport.  Frequent landslides between Manali and Rohtang interrupted vehicular movement for many hours on Friday. Although Border Roads Organization (BRO) is working hard to stem landslides using available techniques, these have proved inadequate. While some vehicles dared to cross the damaged stretch, others preferred to return. As weatherman has predicted more rains during the next 48 hours, the ``sinking zone"" near Rohtang is believed to be badly damaged. With fear of stranding at Rohtang, tourists have preferred not to go there, sources said.  BRO second-in-command, Vikran Singh, said that sudden rainfall has triggered landslides in the region and that they were trying hard to release trapped vehicles.
